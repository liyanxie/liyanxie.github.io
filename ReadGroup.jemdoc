== About

The statistical learning theory reading group aims to cover basic theoretical foundation from reading lectures notes by [https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/ Larry Wasserman]: [http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=sml/ Statistical Methods for Machine Learning] and papers to start research in this area.
